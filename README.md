# Pong Wars

A basic pong game built using SVGs, JavaScript, and absolutely no jQuery.

## Summary

- Code-along style project in RED's Web Dev course.
- First time using Webpack instead of Gulp to bundle and load code.
- First time using Babel to compile ES6 into ES5.
- First time working with object-oriented programming.

## Challenges

The most difficult part of this project is still absorbing and understanding JavaScript. The technical jargon has become more familiar and the higher concepts make sense, but I need more practice writing it because I am often at a loss with how to begin, and find that I still take a disturbing amount of time to make a simple thing work. Much like a spoken language, I am at the point where I have basic understanding of what's going on in a given code, but can't quite put together my own sentences and speak it myself all that well.
