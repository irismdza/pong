# Summary

Pong Wars: a basic pong game built with plain vanilla JavaScript.

# Specifications
* Uses SVGs to render pong game with board, paddles, and ball
* First time working with object-oriented programming and classes
* Uses ES2015 constructor and methods
* First time using Webpack instead of Gulp to bundle and load code
* Uses Babel to compile ES6 into ES5
* Triggers audio on paddle bounce
* Triggers new ball on keypress
* Alerts winner at final score

# Challenges
The most difficult thing was understanding where everything was pointing to, especially when using "this". There was a lot of code involved that was very new to me as I've never worked with JavaScript before.

# Takeaways
There is a lot of work that happens behind the scenes to build a simple pong game. It was also fascinating to learn how SVGs are actually built. I definitely want to continue practicing and understanding the language structure and syntax of vanilla JavaScript, because there's a lot of possibility and magic it can create.
